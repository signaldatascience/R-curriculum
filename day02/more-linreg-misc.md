More Linear Regression
======================

Here are two more datasets to look at if you have time.

California Test Score dataset
-----------------------------

Explore questions analogous to the ones above for the `Caschool dataset` in the `Ecdat` library, and interpret the results.

Educational effects of smaller class sizes
------------------------------------------

Open the `Star` dataset from the `Ecdat` library, restricting consideration to those students who were either in regular classes or in small classes. Explore questions analogous to those above, and interpret the results.
