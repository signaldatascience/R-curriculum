Subsetting in R
===============

"Subsetting" refers to the act of getting a "subset" of a list, vector, or other structure in R.

The material is somewhat dry, so feel free to take breaks, but it's important to master it -- subsetting is absolutely essential to doing any substantial amount of work in R.

Keep the `str()` function in mind as you work through this lesson.

Simple single-bracket subsetting
--------------------------------

The simplest form of subsetting uses the single brackets `[` and `]`. We'll cover how this works with a variety of data types. Sometimes, we'll refer to the vector used to subset a different vector as the *index vector*. (For example, in `x[values]`, `values` is the index vector.)

There are three main ways to subset an unnamed vector---figure out how they work by playing around with `x = 1:5`.

* Subsetting with positive integers: `x[c(3,1)]`

* Subsetting with negative integers: `x[-c(3,1)]`, `x[c(-3,-1)]`

* Subsetting with logical vectors: `x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]`

**Exercise.** What happens when you subset with multiple copies of the same positive integer?

**Exercise.** What happens when you subset with numbers that are not whole numbers?

**Exercise.** What happens when you subset with both positive and negative integers?

**Exercise.** What happens when you subset with a logical vector shorter than the vector you're subsetting? Try with short logical vectors of length 1 and 2.

**Exercise.** What happens when there are some `NA` values in the index vector?

Moreover, you can pass in *character vectors* as the index vector to subset based on *names*.

**Exercise.** What happens if you try to subset by name but one of the values you pass in isn't a valid name?

**Exercise.** Use `[]` to play around with subsetting lists. What *type* of object do you get back?

Recall that data frames are simply complex, two-dimensional lists. If you subset with a *single vector*, data frames behave identically to lists. However, you can simultaneously subset both dimensions by passing in *two* vectors. It's easiest to demonstrate:

```r
> df = data.frame(matrix(1:100, nrow=10, ncol=10))
> df
   X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7 X8 X9 X10
1   1 11 21 31 41 51 61 71 81  91
2   2 12 22 32 42 52 62 72 82  92
3   3 13 23 33 43 53 63 73 83  93
4   4 14 24 34 44 54 64 74 84  94
5   5 15 25 35 45 55 65 75 85  95
6   6 16 26 36 46 56 66 76 86  96
7   7 17 27 37 47 57 67 77 87  97
8   8 18 28 38 48 58 68 78 88  98
9   9 19 29 39 49 59 69 79 89  99
10 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
> df[2:4, 3:6]
  X3 X4 X5 X6
2 22 32 42 52
3 23 33 43 53
4 24 34 44 54
```

**Exercise.** Does subsetting a data frame with a single vector select rows or columns?

**Exercise.** What happens when you pass in nothing for one of the two vectors, like with `df[1:2,]` or `df[,5:6]`?

**Exercise.** When subsetting with two vectors, can you pass in a vector of column names?

**Exercise.** What's the difference between (1) subsetting a single column by passing in a single number as the index vector versus (2) subsetting a single column by passing in nothing for the first index vector and a single number for the second index vector?[^learn]

Advanced subsetting
-------------------

Wickham writes:

> There are two other subsetting operators: `[[` and `$` . `[[` is similar to `[`, except it can only return a single value and it allows you to pull pieces out of a list. `$` is a useful shorthand for `[[` combined with character subsetting.

> You need `[[` when working with lists. This is because when `[` is applied to a list it always returns a list: it never gives you the contents of the list. To get the contents, you need `[[`:

This works straightforwardly. Using the same 10-by-10 data frame from earlier, you can grab the contents of the 5th column with `df[[5]]`, `df[["V5"]]`, or `df$V5`. The `$` operator is nearly identical to the `[[` operator.[^pmatch]

There are nuances to the behavior of all of these different operators, but for they most part they aren't important -- we've covered all the essential parts already. If you want to read more about the details, then consult section 3.2.1 in Wickham's *Advanced R*.

Supplementary exercises
-----------------------

You can modify objects by subsetting them and then using a standard assignment operator (`=`) to assign values to the subsets.

In the following, `mtcars` refers to a dataset that's [loaded by default](http://andrewgelman.com/2015/12/23/r-sucks-2/).

Finally, columns of a data frame can be removed by assigning `NULL` to them.

**Exercise.** With a single subset assignment command, change `x = 1:5` to be equivalent to `c(10, 11, 3, 4, 5)`.

**Exercise.** With a single subset assignment command, change `x = 1:10` to be equivalent to `c(1, 100, 3, 100, 5, 10, 7, 100, 9, 100)`. (*Hint:* You can subset with a logical vector.)[^100]

**Advanced R, 3.1.7.2.** Why does `x = 1:5; x[NA]` yield five missing values? (*Hint:* How is it different from `NA_real_`?)

**Advanced R, 3.1.7.4.** Why does `mtcars[1:20]` return an error? How does it differ from the similar `mtcars[1:20, ]`?

**Advanced R, 3.1.7.6.** What does `df[is.na(df)] = 0` do? How does it work?

**Exercise.** Let `x = c("a", "b", "a", "a", "b", "x", "b", "a")`. Construct a named vector called `fruits` such that the output of `fruits[x]` is equal to `c("apple", "banana", "apple", "apple", "banana", NA, "banana", "apple")`.

**Exercise.** Using the `order()` function, write a function to alphabetize the columns of a data frame by their names.

**Exercise.** Using the `sample()` function, write a function that takes a data frame as input and returns it with the order of its columns randomly permuted. After that, add a logical (boolean) flag to the function's parameters called `rows` defaulting to `FALSE` that permutes the rows as well if set to `TRUE`. (*I.e.*, calling `f(df)` would be equivalent to calling `f(df, rows=FALSE)` but `f(df, rows=TRUE)` would permute rows as well as columns.)

**Exercise.** Write a function that takes a data frame `df` and an integer `k` as input and returns `k` random columns of `df`, *sampled with replacement*.

**Exercise.** Write a function that takes a data frame `df` and an integer `m` as input and returns a random sample of `m` continuous rows of `df` as the output. (By continuous, we mean that you would return row `i`, row `i+1`, ... all the way to row `i+m-1` for some `i`.)

**Exercise.** Write a function that takes a data frame `df` and a string `colname` as input and returns a dataframe without any columns that have name equal to the value of `colname`. (*Hint:* Don't forget about the edge case where multiple columns have identical names.)

[^learn]: You'll very soon learn an easier way of grabbing the vector directly.

[^pmatch]: There's one minor exception. `x$y` is actually equivalent to `x[["y", exact = FALSE]]`, so `$` can partially match names (starting from the beginning of the string). For example, if `df` has a column named `"column"`, then `df$c` will return the output of `df$column`, assuming that no other columns in `df` have a name beginning with `"c"`.

[^100]: A good way to do this is with `x[x %% 2 == 0] = rep(100, length(x[x %% 2 == 0]))`. We pass in the value of `length(...)` instead of `5` directly to improve the robustness of our code -- our manual calculation of the value `5` could be incorrect.
