Text should be displayed at fullwidth in a pad, and in a column of \"xxx\" px max in a 24\" or 42\" screen. Line breaks won't be the same depending on the support, so manually breaking lines can make reading harder."

    "body": "Curious situation where I find myself installing linux while laughing at the absurdity of the Linux core team.\n\nWe're supposed to format our input for your preferred display device? What? Why should data need to be formatted for your terminal when it is viewed in many different environments. Besides, my terminal is more than 80 characters wide. What universe do you live in?\n\nThe real culprit is the utter inadequacy of plain-text. This was obvious from my first *nix experiences, when awk couldn't consume stdin because some data contained whitespace, ruining its ability to distinguish columns. Here it shows itself again. Instead of addressing this root problem, we're bikeshedding about number of characters per line."

    "body": "@JoshCheek @richo I wrote a patch a few months ago that adds line wrapping to Git. It wraps commit messages to the width of your terminal when you read them, and respects convention — lines that begin with whitespace are not wrapped, lines that look like list items are wrapped with hanging indents.\n\n[Here’s a squash commit](https://github.com/Sidnicious/git/commit/f8d2586215df26aff1fc66281d4f2b44227844bc) of the changes. Below is an example. The patch was rejected by the Git maintainer, whose objections were similar to what @torvalds brought up in this thread, but I believe that formatting conventions have become consistent enough that it makes sense to move the responsibility for line wrapping to the tools (a good example being comment formatting here on the GitHub website, and on programming websites like Stack Overflow where human-language text is regularly mixed with code).\n\n![in a terminal window, a commit message which was not hard wrapped is now wrapped to the window’s width.](http://i.imgur.com/6A0CJ.png)"
