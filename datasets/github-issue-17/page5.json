I think github does a stellar job at *hosting*.\n\nAnd that's what I use github for. Sure, I get to host the kernel over\nkernel.org too, but hey, distributed systems are all good, there's no\nreason not to allow people to fetch from github if they want to, and\nas a nice backup plan.\n\nSo github is great at hosting, and I think using those excellent\nhosting facilities is great.\n\nI think github is horrible at creating commits or pull requests, but I\ndon't *use* those facilities, so quite frankly, I don't really care\nthat much.\n\nI'm perfectly happy to argue about it until the cows come home,\nthough. I don't mind *arguing*. It's one of my favorite hobbies, in\nfact.\n\nI turned off the github \"issue tracking\" and \"wiki\" things for the\nkernel, because I don't want to use it, we have better models\nelsewhere.\n\nThe github pull requests I can't turn off, despite us having better\nmodels elsewhere. So if I get one, I instead tell people why they are\nreally horrible, and get to be snarky at the same time.\n\nEnd result: if somebody *else* wants to use github pull requests, go\nwild. If you use them for the kernel, you need to first get github to\ndo a better job at it, though. Or live through me cursing at you and\ncalling you names.\n\n                    Linus"

    "body": "@Sidnicious I would imagine it was rejected because there is a large minority of cases where you don't want a line larger than 72 columns to be wrapped--it's often more important to see how the text was originally formatted, and a set of error messages starts to look terrible when they're a bit too long for the terminal. Often, the first 72 characters are enough to get the meaningful bit of the error message (especially when you have several related in a row); when it's not enough, the reader can choose to resize his terminal, swap to the next set of columns, etc.\n\nSince it's hard to automatically word wrap prose but not code/error messages/program output/etc., and the functionality is not universal, it makes sense to place the onus on the writer to format his text in a way that will be easily readable for a large set of readers. As with writing in general, the writer cares more about having his output read than the reader cares about reading it; spelling rules and grammar conventions exist to provide a low barrier for the reader to quickly understand the writer, not just so teachers can slap wrists over syntax. Likewise, conventions about formatting and what data to include are provided so that the reader can parse your output quickly and move on to one of the hundreds of other similar pieces he needs to address.\n\n80 characters has remained a safe convention not because it's the widest anyone thinks a terminal should be, but because it's a safe minimum that everyone can expect, and which tends to work well for visually scanning, at least at current font sizes. The width has the added benefit of allowing developers to have multiple windows visible on their fancy modern screens with the knowledge that there is an accepted width to which they can shrink their terminal and still get predicted behavior out of 90% of the data they can read. I currently have several dozen windows open, and almost a dozen tiled visibly on my screen; I'm very happy that I've been able to keep my terminal at the same width for several days and meet pretty much all of my needs.\n\nAt any rate, I haven't seen anywhere that @torvalds thinks GitHub should require every user to follow his desired convention--he simply thinks the tools should be reworked so that they enable and encourage developers to do so. Imply that certain pieces of information and formatting rules are desired, and many new users would fall into the habit. Several people have mentioned a markup that would allow GitHub to know what to wrap and what not to; this would allow a maintainer to set conventions for their individual repo, and would produce better output with less effort from the writer. While this would do less to educate new git users about useful conventions, it would still lead to better output.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's the writer's job to ease the reader's job, and it's the tool's job to ease the writer's job. An optional/default setting in the tool and perhaps viewers that makes it easier for people to follow convention without worry (heck, I didn't know that the git convention was 72 as opposed to the traditional 80 until I read this thread) would go a long way."

Not everyone uses GitHub to contribute code to the kernel.\n2. The Linux kernel source is hosted in multiples places, GitHub is just one of them.\n\nTherefore  adding GitHub-specific instructions to the README wouldn't make sense for those cases when the kernel source is hosted somewhere else.\n\nWhy not fix the real problem instead? Adding GitHub-specific instructions to the README is a band-aid solution to a problem that can be fixed *now*.\n\n# FIX GITHUB, SOLVE THE REAL PROBLEM"
