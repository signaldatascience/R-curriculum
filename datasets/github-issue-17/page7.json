I wonder if he would also still be at least that rude with each and everyone of *those people with lower standards that try to get their commits included in the kernel* in person ...at fist range?\r\n\r\nSo much for a __*benevolent*__ dictator for life... if such a thing even exists."

    "body": "@Ismael-VC, I think you are seeing things in the wrong perspective.\r\nIt seems to me that you assume wrong things and if you read carefully above, Linus explained that in the first comment. He got upset when other ppl jumped into the thread and said \"open an exception\", which I must agree, makes **no sense** to open an exception just because it is 3 lines of code...\r\n\r\nThere are standards that Linux project is following and all of that is well documented already, thus making statements/comments like those are just a waste of Linus and other ppl's time. If the maintainers of the project (and community) already spent their own time to write those standards and to share them with the community (giving it for free), I strongly believe that all we (including n00bs) should do is: RTFM!\r\nI often see n00bs on forums asking things that could clearly be found by researching a little bit more. It is a my time vs your time problem.\r\n\r\nSeems like that you did the same mistake and judged the entire thread.\r\nI would probably burst too and would have the same reaction when I read the comment:\r\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5659884\r\n\r\nDon't you think that was being disrespectful? I do :smile: \r\n\r\n@leonklingele, please unsubscribe the thread (it is easier to press that button than it is to make a comment here)."
