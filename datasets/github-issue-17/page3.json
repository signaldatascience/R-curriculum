Seriously how hard is it to make a text field validator for respecting git commit messages ? "

For all I know, this may be a necessary strategy, though it's certainly not one I would find productive. But luckily for him, I'm not him. I do know prominent open sourcerers who are, I wouldn't say harassed, but certainly imposed upon mercilessly. The \"nice guys\" end up conscientiously dealing with at least some of the traffic, which takes up time that could be spent working or with their families and friends.\n\nBut the most important points have almost been lost in the noise: a) @torvalds made explicit complaints about the github pull request, with cogent reasons why it was unsatisfactory; b) Github responded (nice to know they watch their logs) explaining that they are aware of the shortcomings, and others not mentioned, and are working towards fixing it.\n\nIt's pointless to argue and bicker\nLinus doesn't respond to a clicker\nSo just make a note\nHe's a crabby old goat\nAnd then we'll all get along quicker\n\nThe Miss Manners conversation can now continue :)\n"

It is an operating system kernel -- the most fundamental, critical software component of your entire computer. If it goes wrong, everything goes wrong. On top of that, it is probably the most widely deployed OS kernel in the world, being used from everything from transport to logistics to medicine to the military to aerospace. Many of these are applications where people could be killed if things went wrong.\n\nA system of that nature requires much more care and attention to detail than your average vim setup or pet weekend IOC container. If that extends to issues as seemingly trivial (to some people) as word wrapping on check-in comments, then so be it. And if the lead developer of a project such as that does get sharp with people, it's not unfriendliness and political incorrectness, but simply due care and attention with regards to the bigger picture and the stakes being so much higher."

    "body": "@n3storm @SkaveRat : I don't share your opinion about auto-wrapped email.\n\nFirst, I feel sick reading those auto-wrapped comments in this thread because I always make a \"stop breath\" after each end of line. It's not natural, especially with non-monospace font. Imagine reading a book where text is not justified and text width is 3/4 of the page. That'd be weird.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to format the text displayed in a web page. If your feel uncomfortable with reading all other comments, maybe the designers at GitHub should change the font-size or the `.discussion-timeline` div width. The only reason is if you read that thread on your terminal... which leads to my second point.\n\nMy second point is : **I don't read my emails on a terminal!**, like most of people. I hate when somebody send me (wrapped) text-only email that are very hard to read on a smartphone (need to scroll horizontally), and often looks weird on the web interface, like @fogleman noticed it here.\n\nThat could be compared to a width-fixed content like PDF which is not adaptable (/responsive) for all supports, whereas HTML is.\n\nOn the other hand, most people use a terminal or a monospaced text editor/IDE to code and use git. That's why I totally agree on wrapping message commits, but not in emails or in comments.\n\nSo my opinion is: don't use a web UI as your main tools to make commits -- most people work locally anyway, this is just here to provide a quick (and crappy, ok) solution when you don't have your usual working environment. But Github pull requests are really awesome and are much more user-friendly than emails."

Pull requests (and issues, which are very related) here are a replacement for mailing lists. It’s where the discussion is going on. All the data you mention is available in a pull request as well, just not *that* visible. Instead you have to look at the commits appended to the request, or the diff view that’s next to the discussion tab.\n\nObviously that’s not how you do things. You are an email person, using mailing lists as the main (if not only) way to discuss and propose changes to your projects. And I think that is perfectly fine, especially looking at how well it works with your projects.\n\nBut I don’t think that makes pull requests on GitHub inferior. They are different, yes, they require a different workflow, but that workflow works extremely well for many projects, especially those that are not using other means for communication (like mailing lists).\n\nA bad style for commit messages or reasoning of commits and pull request does not come automatically with pull requests on GitHub, the same way as a good style does not come automatically with mailing lists. I’ve seen many perfectly described commits in a well-reasoned pull requests on GitHub, and I’ve also seen as many bad requests in mailing lists. You can do both good and bad things with either (or any) system, and I personally think GitHub offers a great system for projects that are not as busy as the kernel or Git itself."
