Perhaps if it was more like the commit form that the [GitHub application has](http://www.forgetfoo.com/images/blog/github-mac-app-commit.png).\n\nSince this is seems so important, perhaps git should enforce this style by rejecting any commits with a message that does not adhere to your specification?"

If the hub of a project is the ML there are better chances that things are discussed before turning into code that will be refused. Even when the approach starts with a patch, it gets publicly discussed by interested parties, and a long term trace remains in the ML archive. It's a pretty different way of doing this, that was used to build a lot of code with success, and one that works better for a project where patches and new ideas are scrutinized in depth before being accepted."

    "body": "@torvalds I would like to take this oppurtunity to say thanks for Linux and git. For without both of those this great coding community wouldn't have had a chance.\n\nI'd also like to point out something else GitHub does do really well. This. What we are doing right now. Socially coding in an open environment. Talking about things, being connected. Hell when I was growing up I never thought I'd get a chance to say something that Linus effing Torvalds would get to read and possibly comment on, and now here I am, able to put in my two cents (in a flood of thousands of pennies). So thankyou. Thankyou Linus for making git and Linux, and thankyou GitHub for making coding social."

Then you could see clearly what the short and long messages would look and could adjust accordingly (this is done in Stack Overflow and is very helpful). \n\nThe last issue is that monospace is required to view / wrap correctly. A natural way to handle this is to use the markdown four space indent syntax, but since this could get annoying it might be better to have an input type pulldown (text vs markdown) in the same way editing GitHub wikis allows.\n"

    "body": "On Fri, May 11, 2012 at 4:12 PM, orblivion\n<reply@reply.github.com>\nwrote:\n> Unless you somehow enforce that everybody under you also refuses Github pull requests, your logs could still get soiled.\n\nI'm not a \"rules over everything else\" kind of black-and-white person.\n\nI'm basically describing what *my* requirements are. Not all Linux\nsub-maintainers are necessarily as critical as I am, and yes, there\nare ugly commit messages in the kernel too (and some of them are very\nmuch about lacking proper word wrapping, for example).\n\nSo things slip through occasionally. I'm not German - rules are good,\nand they set a standard that people should really try to strive for\n(and quite frankly, hopefully exceed: the \"formatting rules\" should\npreferably go with \"really good and readable message that really\nexplains what is going on\"), but rules are not some kind of absolute\nthing that have to be 100% guaranteed.\n\nIn the kernel, see commit cb8722d30c20, for example. That's a case of\n\"oops, that's one long line\". It happens, and I got it through David\nMiller, who usually doesn't have those kinds of issues. I suspect the\npatch came from somebody who used an annoying editor or MUA that has\nproblems wrapping lines properly (sometimes, you have to disable\nword-wrap in the MUA for it to not corrupt patches, but then some\nMUA's have a horrible editor that doesn't help you wrap lines when you\nwant to!).\n\nSo I don't worry about \"still get soiled\". Crap happens, we try to minimize it.\n\nWhat I dislike about the github thing is that it's not \"crap happens,\nwe'll try to minimize it\", it's \"crap absolutely *WILL* happen\".\nInstead of trying to minimize it, the commit message editor actively\n*revels* in it, and makes it hard not to make a crappy message.\n\nSimilarly, the pull request interface of github makes it literally\n*impossible* to make a good pull request. You literally cannot make a\ngood pull request using the github web interface.\n\nSo right now, I encourage people to use github as a hosting site, but\nas a hosting site *only*. Don't create commits there, and don't use\ngithub for pull requests. Do your commits on your own machine, push\nthem to github, and then when you're ready for a pull request, again\ndo it on your own machine and email it to the maintainer that way.\n\nSo I'm really not trying to hate on github. I only despise a few of\nthe small details of github.\n\nGithub as a hosting site for open-source (or closed, for that matter)\nprojects is *wonderful*.\n\nGithub as a place to generate commits and pull requests? Not so much.\n\n                        Linus"
