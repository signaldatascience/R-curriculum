Seems hard to stop that.\n\nRead my email.\n\nI have no problem with people using github as a hosting site.\n\nBut in order for *me* to pull from github, you need to\n\n (a) make a real pull request, not the braindamaged crap that github\ndoes when you ask it to request a pull: real explanation, proper email\naddresses, proper shortlog, and proper diffstat.\n\n (b) since github identities are random, I expect the pull request to\nbe a signed tag, so that I can verify the identity of the person in\nquestion.\n\nI also refuse to pull commits that have been made with the github web\ninterface. Again, the reason for that is that the way the github web\ninterface work, those commits are invariably pure crap. Commits done\non github invariably have totally unreadable descriptions, because the\ngithub commit making thing doesn't do *any* of the simplest things\nthat the kernel people expect from a commit message:\n\n - no \"short one-line description in the first line\"\n\n - no sane word-wrap of the long description you type: github commit\nmessages tend to be (if they have any description at all) one long\nunreadable line.\n\n - no sign-offs etc that we require for kernel submissions.\n\ngithub *could* make it easy to write good commit messages and enforce\nthe proper \"oneliner for shortlogs and gitk, full explanation for full\nlogs\". But github doesn't. Instead, the github \"commit on the web\"\ninterface is one single horrible text-entry field with absolutely no\nsane way to write a good-looking message.\n\nMaybe some of this has changed, I haven't checked lately. But in\ngeneral, the quality of stuff I have seen from people who use the\ngithub web interfaces has been so low that it's not worth my time.\n\nI'm writing these explanations in the (probably vain) hope that people\nwho use github will actually take them to heart, and github will\neventually improve. But right now github is a total ghetto of crap\ncommit messages and unreadable and unusable pull requests.\n\nAnd the fact that other projects apparently have so low expectations\nof commit messages that these things get used is just sad. People\nshould try to compare the quality of the kernel git logs with some\nother projects, and cry themselves to sleep.\n\n                   Linus"

    "body": "     - no sane word-wrap of the long description you type: github commit\n    messages tend to be (if they have any description at all) one long\n    unreadable line.\n\nI think this is only because people who are new to Git are using GitHub and not understanding about Git-style committing. Remember, a lot of these newbies are just out of the gate from using SVN for years. I bet a lot of them don't even realize that `git commit` with the \"-m\" omitted just opens up COMMIT_EDITMSG in your editor. It isn't even very apparent (to newbies) of the 50-char title rule and 72-char every other line rule with commit messages.\n\n    github *could* make it easy to write good commit messages and enforce\n    the proper \"oneliner for shortlogs and gitk, full explanation for full\n    logs\". But github doesn't. Instead, the github \"commit on the web\"\n    interface is one single horrible text-entry field with absolutely no\n    sane way to write a good-looking message.\n\nI have to agree with you there. Commit message viewing on Github sucks and I hope they change it soon. "

This supports new lines and makes it easy to do nicely formatted commit messages :)\n\nNo it doesn't.\n\nWhat it supports is writing long lines that you have not a f*cking\nclue how long they are. The text area does not do line breaks for you,\nand you have no way to judge where the line breaks would go.\n\nIn other words, it makes it very hard indeed to do \"nicely formatted\ncommit messages\". It also doesn't enforce the *trivial* \"oneliner for\nshortlog\" model, so the commit messages often end up looking like\ntotal crap in shortlogs and in gitk.\n\nSo the github commit UI should have\n - separate \"shortlog\" one-liner text window, so that people cannot\nscrew that up.\n - some way to actually do sane word-wrap at the standard 72-column mark.\n - reminders about sign-offs etc that some projects need for\nproject-specific or even legal reasons.\n\nIt didn't do any of those last time I checked.\n\n                  Linus"

Naively, it seems like that should be a display property of the editor used to write the commit message or the tool used to display the commit message.\n\nNo it shouldn't.\n\nWord-wrapping is a property of the *text*. And the tool you use to\nvisualize things cannot know. End result: you do word-wrapping at the\nonly stage where you *can* do it, namely when writing it. Not when\nshowing it.\n\nSome things should not be word-wrapped. They may be some kind of\nquoted text - long compiler error messages, oops reports, whatever.\nThings that have a certain specific format.\n\nThe tool displaying the thing can't know. The person writing the\ncommit message can. End result: you'd better do word-wrapping at\ncommit time, because that's the only time you know the difference.\n\nSure, the alternative would be to have commit messages be some\nnon-pure-textual format (html or similar). But no, that's not how git\ndoes things. Sure, technically it could, but realistically the rule is\nsimple: we use 72-character columns for word-wrapping, except for\nquoted material that has a specific line format.\n\n(And the rule is not 80 characters, because you do want to allow the\nstandard indentation from git log, and you do want to leave some room\nfor quoting).\n\nAnyway, you are obviously free to do your commit messages any way you\nwant. However, these are the rules we try to follow in the kernel, and\nin git itself.\n\nAnd quite frankly, anybody who thinks they have better rules had\nbetter prove their point by showing a project with better commit\nmessages. Quite frankly, I've seen a lot of open-source projects, and\nI have yet to see *any* project that does a better job of doing good\ncommit messages than the kernel or git. And I've seen a *lot* of\nprojects that do much worse.\n\nSo I would suggest taking the cue for good log messages from projects\nthat have proven that they really can do good log messages. Linux and\ngit are both good examples of that.\n\n                 Linus"
