    "body": "Guys, remember that GitHub was built with both beginners and advanced programmers like Linus in mind. The interface may seem crappy to an advanced programmer but it needs to be beginner friendly, and since these people may have little or no experience with Git, they made the interface the way it is. I can understand where Linus is coming from, being a developer of Git and also working on the Linux Kernel (which has strict standars just btw), but the goals of GitHub (Being beginner friendly and general purpose) and Linus (creating and maintaining an OS kernel with strict standards on pulls and pushes, with official commit messages) are different. GitHub just isn't suited to the stricter standards behind development of a kernel. I think Linus may be a tad unreasonable for not accepting PR's just because there are beginners to Git on this site making requests who are amazing programmers, but are making them via GitHub because that is the only interface they are used to. That is all."
