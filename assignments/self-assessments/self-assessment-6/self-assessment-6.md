Today, you'll be completing a short assessment so that we can get a better sense of your individual level of progress.

* Type your answers in a new R script file with comments indicating where the answer to each question begins.

* When you finish, mail `signaldatascience@gmail.com` with your R script attached along with the amount of time you spent on the self assessment.

* Work individually. You can however consult R documentation, look at old assignments, use the Internet, etc., but don't copy and paste code verbatim.

* Make your code as clear, compact, and efficient as possible. Use everything that you've learned! **Please comment and organize your code so we can easily tell how parts of your R script correspond to specific problems.**
