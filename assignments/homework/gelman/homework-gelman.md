title: "Homework: Reading from Gelman and Hill"
---

Over the next *three nights*, you'll be working through various sections of [Data Analysis Using Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/) by Gelman and Hill. Chapters 3 through 5 of this book are located in the `readings/gelman` folder of the GitHub curriculum repository.

The reading assignments are given below (one per night):

* **Assignment 1:** Sections 3.1--3.3 and 3.6--3.7.
* **Assignment 2:** Sections 4.1--4.3.
* **Assignment 3:** Sections 5.1--5.2 and 4.4--4.6.

As you read, follow through the text and work through the examples in an R script of your own. Include your interpretation of the results as comments. Gelman uses `display()` from his own custom package, but you can just use `summary()` if you want.
