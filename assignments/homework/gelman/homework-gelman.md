title: "Homework: Reading from Gelman and Hill"
---

Over the next *three nights*, you'll be working through various sections of [Data Analysis Using Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/) by Gelman and Hill. Chapters 3 through 5 of this book are located in the `readings/gelman` folder of the GitHub curriculum repository.

The reading assignments are given below (one per night):

* **Assignment 1:** Sections 3.1--3.3 and 3.6--3.7.
* **Assignment 2:** Sections 4.1--4.3.
* **Assignment 3:** Sections 5.1--5.2 and 4.4--4.6.

As you read, follow through the text and work through the examples in an R script of your own. Include your interpretation of the results as comments. Gelman uses `display()` from his own custom package, but you can just use `summary()` if you want.

Look on [Gelman's website](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/software/) for the datasets used in his book. Download both

> [Zip file with R/Bugs code](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/Book_Codes.zip) for most of the examples from the book.

and

> [Zip file with data](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/ARM_Data.zip) for most of the examples and exercises from the book.

referring to the former to see which datasets to load from the latter.

If the above links don't work, the files are also available in the `datasets/gelman-hill` folder of our repository.
