Over the weekend, work through the 11 tutorials at [SQLZoo](http://sqlzoo.net/). SQL is *very* useful for interview questions and is relatively straightforward to learn, so we'll be practicing it continuously throughout the course.

Sometimes, the SQLZoo parser is a little picky and won't accept your answer even though it's functionally correct. This doesn't happen often, but if you find that you get stuck for some reason, you can check what the intended answers are by first (1) opening the SQLZoo page in a different web browser or incognito window and then (2) appending *?answer=1* to the end of the URL. In general, try not to spend too long on any individual question; it's fine to refer to the solutions as long as you make sure you understand how they work.
