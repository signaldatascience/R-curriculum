things to improve about the curriculum

Incorporate into R curriculum:
- match(), model.matrix()

Parallelization:

- http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/01/running-r-jobs-quickly-on-many-machines/

SVMs:
- support vector explanation
- discriminant analysis exercises need work

- add historical notes to EVERYTHING
- add profiler to R curriculum, *maybe* debugger
- add more about Github API to scraping+nlp (for time argument)
- find good place for <<- operator
- more sorting algorithms
- memoisation in 1st assignment -- need <<- or something else
- softimpute
- how to make graphs properly / present / etc
- resampling: add exposition on why higher/lower n for n-fold cv
- time series: can't use normal resampling
