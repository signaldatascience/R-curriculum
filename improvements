- http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/01/running-r-jobs-quickly-on-many-machines/

SVMs:
- support vector explanation
- discriminant analysis exercises need work

http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/fogm/2015F/

- add historical notes to EVERYTHING
- add profiler to R curriculum, *maybe* debugger
- add more about Github API to scraping+nlp (for time argument)
- find good place for <<- operator
- more sorting algorithms
- memoisation in 1st assignment -- need <<- or something else
- softimpute
- how to make graphs properly / present / etc
- add http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html to precourse
- https://gist.github.com/hadley/6734639
- coef.glmnet and predict.glmnet
- example of factor analysis outperforming regularization
- add more to clustering assignment
- add ~1 more hour of work to factor analysis assignment

- resampling: add exposition on why higher/lower n for n-fold cv
http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/27730/choice-of-k-in-k-fold-cross-validation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)

- time series: can't use normal resampling

TODO SOON:
- Weekend 2 homework: SQL
- Notes and slides for cross entropy
- Notes and slides for topological data analysis (+ short assignment?)
- Read more Vapnik
