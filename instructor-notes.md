The sections are ordered chronologically.

At the end of each day, students should be instructed to read the next day's assignment.

R curriculum
============

This portion of the curriculum takes approximately 1 week. It covers the basics of R and linear regression and is probably the most critical portion of the curriculum. Take special care to pair stronger students with weaker students, as aweak--weak pair is disastrous at this early stage.

Assignments should be done in this order:

1. *R: Basics*, *R: Atomic Vectors and Functions*, *Linear Regression: Infant Mortality*, and *Linear Regression: Galton's Height Data*
2. *R: Data Frames* and *Linear Regression: Simulated Data*
3. *R: Attributes, Factors, and Matrices*
4. *R: Functional Programming*

In the above list, each list item's contents should be assigned in the morning.

For buffer, use *R: Basic Algorithms*, which can be completed directly after *R: Data Frames*, and *R: Spellchecking*, which should be done after *R: Functional Programming*.

On the first weekend, assign the completion of old work along with [SQLZoo](http://sqlzoo.net/) tutorials. If there will be a self-assessment after the weekend, give students advance notice of this.

Give students *Self-Assessment 1* (SA1) after all the R basics have been introduced. SA1 will take 3--5 hours based on student strength, so allocate 4 hours for its completion with a lunch break in between. Afterward, go over solutions and give students a half-hour break. Time after completing SA1 can be used for catching up on old work. There is a theoretical solution to Part 1, which can be mentioned in the presentation of R code solutions and presented *only* to those students who are interested. **Important:** Depending on how many days occur before the weekend, students or may not have had a chance to learn SQL, so the SQL questions on SA1 may have to be removed.

It should be emphasized to students that they should make extra effort to wrap up any loose ends in the core R curriculum after SA1, as they will be moving on to more substantive data science material afterward.

Resampling and regularization
=============================

This portion of the curriculum takes approximately 1 week. It covers n-fold cross validation and elastic net regularization in the context of linear regression and also briefly touches upon bootstrapping.

The assignments in this section are:

1. *Linear Regression: Resampling*
2. *Linear Regression: Regularization*
3. *Linear Regression: Kaggle Africa Soil Challenge*

*Linear Regression: Resampling* takes 1 to 1.5 days. Allocate a full day plus the next day's morning to it, presenting solutions before lunchtime. The last section, describing additional analyses, is of lesser importance and can serve as buffer for those who finish early. After lunchtime, give a presentation on regularized linear regression. (*Don't* assign the regularization assignment as reading beforehand; it assumes theoretical understanding of regularization.) Students can then work on *Linear Regression: Regularization*, which takes (...)

After *Linear Regression: Kaggle Africa Soil Challenge*, give students *Self-Assessment 2* (SA2). Allocate 4 hours for SA2 with a lunch break in between, present solutions at the end, and then have a half-hour break. After the break, students can work on finishing up old assignments, revising their self-assessment code, or working on buffer assignments. It may make sense to give students the first logistic regression assignment before SA2, especially if students seem mentally exhausted and might need a weekend to absorb resampling and regularization at a deeper level before doing SA2.
