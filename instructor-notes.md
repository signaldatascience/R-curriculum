R curriculum
============

* It's particularly important to pair up weaker students with stronger students in the first week. Randomized assignment is fine after that, but a weak--weak pair is very bad in the early stages.

Self Assessments

Self Assessment 1
-----------------

* Takes 3-5 hours depending on student strength. Recommend allocating 4 hours, with lunch break in between. Students can catch up on material afterward.

* Theoretical solution to Part 1 can be mentioned as part of in-class demonstration of R code solutions and also potentially demonstrated after class for interested students.
