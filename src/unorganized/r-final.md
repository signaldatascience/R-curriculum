====================================

Spelling correction is one of the most natural and oldest natural language processing tasks. It may seem like a difficult task to you at the moment, but it's surprisingly easy to write a spellchecker that does fairly well. (Of course, companies like Google spend millions of dollars making their spellcheckers better and better, but we'll start with something simpler for now.)

* Read Peter Norvig's [How to Write a Spelling Corrector](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html). Recreate it in R and reproduce his results. **After** doing so yourself, read about [this 2-line R implementation](http://www.sumsar.net/blog/2014/12/peter-norvigs-spell-checker-in-two-lines-of-r/) of Norvig's spellchecker.
