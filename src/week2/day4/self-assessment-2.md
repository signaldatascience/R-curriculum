title: Self-Assessment
---

We'll be having another self-assessment. As before,

* Type your answers in a new R script file with comments indicating where the answer to each question begins.

* Write down the current time. Please email us (at `signaldatascience@gmail.com`) with your R script attached after **2 hours** have passed.

* Work individually. You can however consult R documentation, look at old assignments, use the Internet, etc., but don't copy and paste code verbatim.

* Make your code as clear, compact, and efficient as possible. Use everything that you've learned!
