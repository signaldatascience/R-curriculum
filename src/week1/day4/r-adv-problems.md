Advanced Problems in R
======================

Now that you're acquainted with the basics of R's functional programming toolkit and have a strong grasp of the most important aspects of R's internals, we'll start to focus on developing your R skills in two major ways:

* Learning to fully utilize packages that can make data analysis much faster and easier

* Mastering specific advanced R features

To that end, here's an assortment of instructive exercises. When solving them, you should:

* Aim to write the cleanest, most efficient R code possible.

* If you begin writing code with one approach, and then decide that a different approach is better, consider quantifying the differences in runtime with the `timeit` package.
