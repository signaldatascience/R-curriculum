Why R?

- It's built for statistics and lets you iterate between viewing model results <=> writing more analysis code really quickly
- Python is better for general purpose programming and is better for data scraping, but its data science libraries are clunky & reimplement R stuff
- Ultimately, you want to be comfortable with lots of tools & Python is easier to self-learn

Differences between normal programming and data science programming

- Debugging is harder, because you aren't building a real product and questions are less well-defined
- Way more type coercion
- Do a lot of standard things (which is why R has many inbuilt functions), but combine them in novel ways
